An interpreter for a simple functional language called PLAN. The interpreter was written in Scheme.
A PLAN program is a list, as defined by the following grammar:
⟨P rogram⟩ ::= ( prog ⟨Expr⟩ )
⟨Expr⟩ ::= ⟨I d⟩
           | ⟨Const⟩
           | ( myignore ⟨Expr⟩ )
           | ( myadd ⟨Expr⟩ ⟨Expr⟩ )
           | ( mymul ⟨Expr⟩ ⟨Expr⟩ )
           | ( myneg ⟨Expr⟩ )
           | (mylet ⟨Id⟩ ⟨Expr⟩ ⟨Expr⟩ )
    ⟨I d⟩ ::=a|b|...|z
  ⟨Const⟩ ::= integer constant
